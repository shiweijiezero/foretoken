# Foretoken

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Foretoken is an LLM inference orchestration framework built for SLO/SLA targets and heterogeneous accelerators.

Built on inference engines such as vLLM and SGLang, Foretoken organizes multiple inference instances into a cluster service for request routing, autoscaling, instance management, and benchmarking.
We aim to turn an inference cluster into a token factory that continuously converts compute into tokens while meeting latency and quality requirements.

## When to Use Foretoken

- Serve one or more models across multiple GPUs or nodes.
- Route requests based on load, queue depth, or KV cache state.
- Autoscale inference instances based on traffic and SLO targets.
- Compare aggregated serving, Prefill/Decode disaggregation, and different parallelism strategies.
- Use the same orchestration stack across NVIDIA, MetaX, Huawei Ascend, and other accelerators.

If you only need to serve a single model on one GPU, an inference engine is usually enough.

## Features and Status

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Benchmarking | Performance benchmarks and parameter sweeps, correctness evaluation, and SLO simulation | In development |
| Profiling | Use PyTorch Profiler and Nsight to identify compute, communication, and CPU/GPU bottlenecks | Planned |
| Hardware support | Common interfaces for device capabilities, runtimes, communication, and metrics | In development |
| Request routing | Select instances based on load, queues, KV reuse, and service levels | Research |
| Distributed inference | Aggregated serving, Prefill/Decode disaggregation, and WideEP parallelism | Research |
| Control plane | Model services, instance groups, autoscaling, updates, and failure recovery | Planned |
| Deployment and observability | Kubernetes deployment, metrics, dashboards, and alerts | Planned |

## Getting Started

The `main` branch does not yet contain runnable components. Once the first baseline is merged, this section will provide deployment commands, example requests, and instructions for checking results.
